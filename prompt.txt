in @src\app\page.tsx there is handling of grammar correction tool dont change for any other tool. now problem1 when i input a        
  file it says it gives analyzing message and below it gives another message giving original document( whose html i am rendering) and on  its right side i am showing corrected html . 
  even when  complete output is given the analyzing message still remains and there is nothing to know that         
   corrcted response is completed give an option to paste the corrected response. second problem         
  the ui of grammar correction @src/components/GrammarCorrectionView.tsx looks very lame (one side       
  original and other side correct with just a sinle line). use new libraries and if possible compare the original and            
  corrected to show the changes ,, so that user knows where changes. use the space and width of the grammarcorrectionview to show the       
   responses and inputs.
